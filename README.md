# How Challenging to Identify Real Code Authors: An Empirical Study

## Project summary

Identifying code authors is important in various research topics, and various approaches (e.g., [1]) have been proposed. 
Although these approaches achieve promising results on their datasets, their true effectiveness is still in question. 
To the best of our knowledge, only one large-scale study (e.g., [2]) was conducted to explore the impacts of factors (e.g., the temporal effect and the distributions of files per author).
Although their research questions are interesting, we have low confidence on their answers, since their settings have flaws. 
To improve our understanding on this research problem, we evaluated their approach on more realistic settings. 

To meet the timely needs, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study. In this study, we analyze a more recent version [3] of the approach that is used in the prior study [2].
The prior study [3] mainly uses Google Code Jam programs that are submitted in two years, but we collected 14,657 commits from real projects over twenty years.

Our dataset is stored in the dataset folder.
